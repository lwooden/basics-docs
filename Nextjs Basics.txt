Next.js Basics

What
-------
- Next.js is a flexible React framework that enables developers to build performant web applications

Why
------
- This technology is important because the "NEW" React documentation seems to be pushing developers to adopt mature frameworks over vanilla React
- Create-React-App (CRA) is no longer maintained
- Next.js is the leading server-side rendering (SSR) technology in the market place
- Next.js automates mundane processes like routing, code splitting, SEO, and suspense rendering AUTOMATICALLY so that developers can focus more on implementing business logic
- functions as an "extension" of React

When
-------
- React was introduced in 2013
- Next.js was introduced in October 2016
- Remix came out in 2021


Server-side Rendering
-------------------------------
- when a web page is completely rendered on the server first and then sent to the browser to be displayed
- this significatnly lowers 
- does wonders for SEO



Conventions
-----------------

[ Page Routing ]
- Nextjs adheres to a straightforward folder based routing mechanism which also supports "nested" routes

/app
  /users
    page.js # rendered on https://localhost:300/user
  /posts
    page.js # rendered on https://localhost:300/posts
    /[postId]
      page.js # rendered on https://localhost:300/posts/:postId; this is NESTED route


[ Backend Routing ]
- backend routing follows the same

/app
  /api
    /users
      route.js # endpoint will be listening on http://localhost:3000/api/users
