Django Basics


pip install Django
django-admin startproject notable_django
pip install django-tastypie // api framework
python manage.py startapp api


notable_django
  /api
  /notable_django
  manage.py 
  
  
/api folder handles the actual API magic.
/notable_django contains the settings for the configuration of the project, as well as exposing URLs. 


we have to install our app within our project, inside notable_django/settings-py:

# notable_django/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'api' <----
]

Projects can have multiple apps installed — and those apps aren’t necessarily tied to that project. Our project here is notable_django, and our app is called api.

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migration
python manage.py runserver
