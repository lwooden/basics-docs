Model Context Protocol Basics

[ Overview ]

What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)? 

MCP is an abstraction framework that functions as an api for an api. In other words, it allows me to define an interface upon which I can connect agents to in order to talk to many different backends (.e.g databases, third party applications such as Slack, or other services)

[ Components ]

There are two components in the Model Context Protocol framework

Client ----> Server ----> Service (slack, database, another API)

Client - functions as the agent making the remote call to the service

Server - defines the functions (contracts) that form the rules of engagement for being able to interface with the service it is abstracting; this "server" is essentially code that contains functions that are called by the client. They are no different from modules that are apart of a project
