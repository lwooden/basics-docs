Big Data Basics

4 V's of Big Data
------------------
Volume - large volumes of data
Variety - various forms; structured, semi-structured, unstructured
Velocity - real time, batch, streams of data
Variability - inconsistent, sometimes inaccurate, varying data

Big Data is a result of technology advances and innovations made in the past few decades
Cheap and faster storage + the internet + virtualization + cloud computing

Sources of Big Data
-------------------
Social Media
Machine-Generated Data
Business Transactions
IOT
Sensors

Big Data Example
----------------
UPS uses sensors on its vehicles to monitor speed, miles per gallon, mileage, number of stops and engine health.
 - UPS collects [200 data points] for each 80,000 vehicles every day


EDW = Enterprise Data Warehouse


Cycle of Big Data Management
----------------------------
1. Capture - depends of the problem to be solved
2. Organize - cleanse, organize, and validate data
3. Integrate - integrate with business rules or data warehouses
4. Analyze - real-time analysis, batch, reports, visualizations
5. Act - use analysis to solve the business problem 

Layers of Big Data Architecture
--------------------------------
Layer 1: Physical Infrastructure - clusters, network, in-memory analytics
Layer 2: Security & Governance
Layer 3: Data - Text/Audio, Social Media, Machine Generated, Human Generated
Layer 4: Capture - Distributed File Systems, Streaming, NoSQL, RDBMS
Layer 5: Organize & Integrate - Apache Spark, Hadoop, ETL, Data Warehouse
Layer 6: Analyze - Predictive Analytics, Advanced Analytics, Alerts/Recommendations, Visualizations/Reports/Dashboards

*Not an architecture, but a strategy!
