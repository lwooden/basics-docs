Power Platform Basics

Terminology
-----------------

Entity -> Table
Field -> Column
Record -> Row
Option Set -> Choice
Common Data Service -> Dataverse


What Is Power Platform?
----------------------------------
- a suite of tools that includes Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Power Virtual Agents
- these core services are built upon other components called Connectors, AI Builders, and Dataverse
- these solutions also integrate with other Microsoft Platforms like Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365
- this suite is leveraged in order to quickly put together solutions
- aimed at "Citizen Developers" (people who do not have Comp Sci degrees and are not Developers by trade)


Power Apps
-----------------

[ Canvas Apps ]
- builds apps in a drag and drop fashion from scratch, templates, or other data sources (e.g. Sharepoint List)

[ Portal Apps ]
- builds pubic facing web apps that can be browsed (anonymous or authenticated)
- allows users to browse data contained in the Dataverse

[ Model Driven Apps ]
- builds apps on top of the Dataverse using models/relationships (e.g. think ORM)


Power Automate
----------------------
- used to automate workflows and processes
- these flows have to connect to datasources via Connectors

Connectors -> Triggers (button click) -> Actions


Power BI
-----------
- used to visualize and analysis data to provide intelligence in order to make organizational decisions


Power Virtual Agents
---------------------------
- can be used to create chatbots that interface with customers in order to provide a service (e.g. customer support)



Core Components
------------------------

[ Connectors ]
- wrappers around APIs
- the bridge between datasources and power applicaitons

Triggers
	notification when an event occurs
		Polling Triggers
		Pushing Triggers

Actions
	interaction with/on a datasource
	
	
Standard Connectors 
	interfaces to standard apps like Sharepoint, Outlook, etc

Premium Connectors
	interfaces for more complex platforms like Azure SQL, Workday

Custom Connectors


[ Dataverse - Common Data Service (CDS) ]
- scalable database service that is used to store and manage data that's used by the Power Platform
- is created on a per environment basis

Security
	authentication managed via Azure AD (with MFA and Conditional Access)
	row/field level security can be enforced as well
	
Storage
	stores physical data in Azure
	

Import/Export
	can get data in and out using APIs, webhooks, and data exports

[ AI Builder ]
- provides pre-built and trainable AI models 


Structure
------------

Geographical Region (e.g. United States)
	Environments
		Production Environment
			- used for permanent workloads that will run in the organization
		Default Environment
			- automatically created by default for each Azure AD tenant
			- should not be used for Production workloads due to limitations
		Sandbox Environment
			- non-production work
		Trial Environment
			- short term testing needs		
		Developer Environment
			- special environment restricted to a SINGLE user
		Teams Environment
			- auto created when Teams users start using Power Apps
