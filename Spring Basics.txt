Spring Basics


The Spring Framework
--------------------------------
- Spring is Java's core MVC framework used to build web applications and restful services
- Spring functions similiar to .NETCore MVC scaffolding and dependency injection setup
- contains a number of helper packagaes like springboot, spring initilizer to help you get started
- wraps alot of core dependencies/packages into top level "spring-plugins" so that you don't have to download and maintain them individually yourself (GET UP AND RUNNING FASTER)

Spring Web MVC
-----------------------

war - Web Application Archive
jsp - java server pages

we dont need to web.xml file because we will define routes using "annotations"

*it is always best practice to follow the project structure that Maven gives
