(2) types of components:
	
Class Based 
- have the ability to manage local state
- has access to component lifecycle methods


Functional (stateless)
- lightweight
- easy to test
- cannot manage local state
- cannot access lifecycle methods


Class Based Component
--------------------------------

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)

        this.state = {
            ...
        }
 
    }

componentDidMount() {
   ...
}

render() {

        return (
           <div>
           		Welcome to React
           </div>
              )
  }
  
  export default App
  
  
 Functional Component (The Standard)
 ----------------------------------------------------
 
 const App = (props) => {
 	return (
           <div>
           		The Count is {props.count}
           </div>
    )


App.defaultProps = {
  count:0
}

ReactDOM.render(<App count={5} />, document.getElementById('root'));


Common Conditional Rendering Patterns
------------------------------------------------------

[ Ternary Operator ]
- if true, rendering what is on the left side
- if falsey, render what is on the right

// Example
 function App() {
      let isLoggedIn = true;
      return (
        <div>
          {isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please log in.</h1>}
        </div>
      );
    }
    
    export default App;
    
    
[ Logical && Operator ]
- if the left side is true, render what is on the right
- if the left side is false, do not evaluate what is on the right

{ isLoading && <ActivityIndicator /> }

[ Nullish Coalescence ] 
- returns its right-hand side of the operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined

// Example
const nullValue = null;
const valA = nullValue ?? "default for A";

    
    
 
React Hooks
-----------------
- a hook is a simple function with some rules on where we can run them
- hooks return values
- should be defined at the top of the functional component
- if the action that I am performing needs to be aware of the some aspect of the lifecycle of the component that I invoking it in, it should be a hook
- if the action does not need to know about the context of the react component, then it can be a simple function

useState - allows me to use simple state in a stateless functional components
- when using the set operator for a piece of state, the state value is not immediately updated or available
- it will only be accessible at the next render
- trying to access the value before the next render will cause issues


useEffect - implements lifecycle methods in stateless functional components 

// defines a effect that runs when the component is mounted and when the dependency value (isFinished) is updated
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("isFinished: ", isFinished)
    // check if there is a new best score
    if (isFinished && score > bestScore) {
      setBestScore(score)
    }
  }, [isFinished])
  
  // defines an effect with an empty dependency array that will run ONCE ONLY when the component initially mounts
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component is mounted!"
  }, [ ] )
  
useRef -  allows me to reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering; this is valuable if I don't need the UI to change based on a value; state is used for values that need to update the UI when changed
 
useReducer - allows me to manage complex state and provide access to state to the components that need them



useContext - allows me to share values without manually passing props down from the parent


Handling Props
---------------------
Prop Drilling - practice of adding properties to a component with the sole purpose of allowing that component to pass those properties on to other components


Transforming List using Array.Map
----------------------------------------------


const dynamicMenu = [{
    id: 1,
    title: 'Dynamic Home',
    href: '/home',
    icon: 'home'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'Dynamic Services',
    href: '/services',
    icon: 'services'
  }]
  
  <Menu menuList={dynamicMenu} />


function Menu({ menuList }) {
  return (
  <nav>
    <ul className='menu'>
    {menuList.map(({id, href, icon, title}) => 
      <MenuItem key={id} href={href} icon={icon} children={title}></MenuItem>

    )}


React Context
--------------------
- Wraps a number of components with a value that all descendant components can access without going through properties at all.    
- A context in React consists of two parts. It needs a provider, that contains the values that you want to pass to any descendant component, and it needs a consumer, that you use in each descendant component that wants access to the provided value



Fetching Data
--------------------
- data fetching logic is stored in a separate module and brought in to the component that needs to use it
- think actions file for NextJs
- if any component that is wrapped in <Suspense> is throwing promises ("waiting on data to be retrieved") that component is said to be "SUSPENDING"

function App() {
	return (
		<div className="app-wrapper">
			<div className="app">
				<div className="details">
				<ErrorBoundary>
					<Suspense fallback={<ShipFallback />}>
						<ShipDetails />
					</Suspense>
						</ErrorBoundary>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}

// initialize variable to hold results from promise below
let ship: Ship

// define a variable to hold the state of the promise getShip
// assign the results of the getShip function to the variable ship
const shipPromise = getShip(shipName).then((result) => {
	ship = result
})

function ShipDetails() {
	// if the ship hasn't loaded yet, throw the shipPromise
	// React knows what to do with the promise based on its state (rejected, fulfilled, or still pending)
	if (!ship) throw shipPromise
	
	const ship = use(shipPromise) // use React's "use" hook instead which does all of the promise state checking for me

// the results of the ship object will be available to the ShipDetails component if the promise resolves successfully
	return (
		<div className="ship-info">
			<div className="ship-info__img-wrapper">
				<img
					src={getImageUrlForShip(ship.name, { size: 200 })}
					alt={ship.name}
				/>
			</div>
			<section>
				<h2>
					{ship.name}
					<sup>
						{ship.topSpeed} <small>lyh</small>
					</sup>
				</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				{ship.weapons.length ? (
					<ul>
						{ship.weapons.map((weapon) => (
							<li key={weapon.name}>
								<label>{weapon.name}</label>:{' '}
								<span>
									{weapon.damage} <small>({weapon.type})</small>
								</span>
							</li>
						))}
					</ul>
				) : (
					<p>NOTE: This ship is not equipped with any weapons.</p>
				)}
			</section>
			<small className="ship-info__fetch-time">{ship.fetchedAt}</small>
		</div>
	)
}



Suspense
--------------
- handling UI state while data is being fetched
- its best to show the user something (pending state) while asynchronous processes are taking place
- this typical involves rendering a skeleton of some sort to hold the place of the real object until the data fetching is completed (promises resolved)
- wrapping a component in a suspense component basically means "render this skeleton component until I resolve all data fetching related promises)
- it is also good to wrap suspense components with an Error Boundary so that any errors from rejected promises bubble up to the error boundary and are presented to the users accordingly
- as long as I am using a "promise" I can suspend on it 

// ShipFallback is a skeleton component that displays while the real data is being fetched 
function ShipFallback() {
	return (
		<div className="ship-info">
			<div className="ship-info__img-wrapper">
				<img src="/img/fallback-ship.png" alt={shipName} />
			</div>
			<section>
				<h2>
					{shipName}
					<sup>
						XX <small>lyh</small>
					</sup>
				</h2>
			</section>
			<section>
				<ul>
					{Array.from({ length: 3 }).map((_, i) => (
						<li key={i}>
							<label>loading</label>:{' '}
							<span>
								XX <small>(loading)</small>
							</span>
						</li>
					))}
				</ul>
			</section>
		</div>
	)
}
      
Optimistic UI
----------------
- the art of showing the user that an action that they have performed has succeeded although the backend operations have not yet been completed
- example: i liked a tweet on twitter on a slow network along with thousands of other users; the heart turns red
- example: i clicked "Submit" on a form and the button switches to "Submitting..." while the asynchronous operations are happening behind the 
scenes
- this often involves passing an "optimistic" or fake version of the real thing that is being created behind the scenes during a "transition" 
- in this context we can use data that the user provides (name or image via a form) while we create the actual fully loaded object behind the scenes and display that after the fact
 - useOptimistic hook allows me to update state during a transition (e.g.  form submission)
 
 function CreateForm({
	setOptimisticShip,
	setShipName,
}: {
	setOptimisticShip: (ship: Ship | null) => void
	setShipName: (name: string) => void
}) {

	const [message, setMessage] = useOptimistic('Create')
	return (
		<div>
			<p>Create a new ship</p>
			<ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={FormErrorFallback}>
				<form
					action={async (formData) => {
						setMessage('Creating...')
						setOptimisticShip(await createOptimisticShip(formData))

						await createShip(formData, 2000)
						
						setMessage('Created! Loading...')

						setShipName(formData.get('name') as string)
					}}
				>
					<div>
						<label htmlFor="shipName">Ship Name</label>
						<input id="shipName" type="text" name="name" required />
					</div>
					<div>
						<label htmlFor="topSpeed">Top Speed</label>
						<input id="topSpeed" type="number" name="topSpeed" required />
					</div>
					<div>
						<label htmlFor="image">Image</label>
						<input
							id="image"
							type="file"
							name="image"
							accept="image/*"
							required
						/>
					</div>
					<CreateButton children={message} />
				</form>
			</ErrorBoundary>
		</div>
	)
}
