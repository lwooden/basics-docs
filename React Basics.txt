React Basics Doc


(2) types of components:
	
Class Based 
- have the ability to manage local state
- has access to component lifecycle methods


Stateless Functional
- lightweight
- easy to test
- cannot manage local state
- cannot access lifecycle methods


Class Based Component
--------------------------------

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)

        this.state = {
            ...
        }
 
    }

componentDidMount() {
   ...
}

render() {

        return (
           <div>
           		Welcome to React
           </div>
              )
  }
  
  export default App
  
  
 Stateless Functional 
 ---------------------------
 
 const App = () => {
 	return (
           <div>
           		Welcome to React
           </div>
    )
    
    
 
React Hooks

useState - allows me to use state in a stateless functional component
