Reserved Addresses
------------------
.0 - Network Address
.1 - VPC Router
.2 - DNS (Based on VPC CIDR not subnet)
.3 - Resevered for future use
.255 - Broadcast 


Netwok Refresher
----------------

- Every extra bit borrowed from either host/network doubles (x2) the addresses/subnets available
- /23 subnet is twice the size of a /24 and /22 is twice the size of a /23.

192.168.1.0 /22 - 1024 addresses (512 x 2)
192.168.1.0 /23 = 512 addresses(256 x 2)
192.168.1.0 /24 = 256 addresses (128 x 2)
192.168.1.0 /25 = 128 addresses (64 x 2)
192.168.1.0 /26 = 64 addressess

               
Decimal Value 128  64   32   16   8    4    2   1
Bit Position      1      2      3     4    5    6    7   8

Design & Implement AWS Networks
-----------------------------------------------

- Source/Destination Check: if an ENI receives traffic where it recognizes that it is not the source or the destination, by default, it automatically drops the packet (if enabled)

- Security Groups are associated with ENI's! NOT INSTANCES
- Multiple security groups can be associated with an instance (per purpose; i.e Active directory)
- Separate security group for the primary ENI and secondary ENI

- NACL's processes traffic before it enter or leaves a subnet  
- Applies to all instances that live in the subnet

- Route Propagation: dynamically adds any routes learned by the attached VGW to the routing table (i.e. routes learned via BGP); this must be explicitly enabled on the router of your choice; you can also use static routes if a routing protocol is not used to form the VPN

- When two VPCs are peered they can "reference" each others security groups

- Within a VPC the public hostname resolves to the private IP address
- With a VPC peer connection if a instance in VPC-A tries to access a instance in VPC-B via it's public hostname, it real resolve to it's public IP address

- VPC Enpoints: a way of accessing a AWS Public Service from within a VPC, without crossing the VPC boundary (only works with S3 and DynamoDB)


Design & Implement Hybrid Networks at Scale
------------------------------------------------------------

[ Hybrid Architectures ]


People move to the cloud for primarily (2) reasons:

1. Reactive 
2. Proactive 

Reactive is when some kind of event happens 


The subcategories are as follows:

Data center Extension - 

Compliance/Regularoty Reasons -

High Availability/DR -

Dynamic Bursting - 

Organization IT Budget
	CapEx - New equipment 
	CapOps - Operations 


Software Based VPN - good for specific use cases; dont expect 1-10 Gbps performance even with big instances due to encoding/decoding limitations in software (versus hardware)

AWS Managed VPN - resilent; AWS handles most of the heavy lifting; performance is better than software VPN, but if 10 Gbps is needed, consider Direct Connect

Hardware VPN is always preferred!

Make sure the VGW is aware of the prefixes that are being sent from the CGW!

The information in the AWS config specifies (2) types of IPs when it comes to VPNs:
1. Tunnel Interface IP
2. Public Endpoint IP

Routing Decisions
1. Most Specific Prefix
2. Direct Connect
3. Static Route
4. Routes learned from BGP


CloudHUB -> MPLS


 Transitive Networking
-----------------------------

[ Transit Gateway ]

The following objects can attach to a TGW:
- VPCs (different accounts)
- VPN Customer Gateways
- Direct Connect Gateways
- Other TGWs

- Attachments are AWS objects that have their own ID
- Traffic arrivies from an associated attachment and traffic is forwarded to an attachment listed in the TGW route table
- When attaching a VPC to Transit Gateway at least (1) subnet must be chosen from the VPC; this creates a ENI inside that subnet for the TGW to connect to; choose (2) subnets for high-availability
- When attaching a Direct Connect Gateway this is done from the Direct Connect Console not the VPC console; DX connections to the TGW require a TRANSIT VIF (Private and Public VIFs will not work); seperate AS numbers are necessary for the DX and TGW
- Each TGW comes with an INITIAL ROUTE TABLE where are attachements get listed in. Outside of this, up to (20) route tables can be created
- Each attachment can be ASSOCIATED with only (1) route table
- Only (1) default route per route table
- Routes from VPCs to the TGW must be manually added to VPC route tables; routes from VPN Customer Gateways will be learned via BGP
- BY DEFAULT all attachements (networks) are able to reach each other

There are (4) attachments to the TGW:
- 192.168.1.0/24 (VPC)
- 192.168.2.0/24 (VPC)
- 172.16.0.0/16 (DX-Gateway)
- 192.168.3.0/24 (CGW)

Main TGW Route Table
192.168.1.0/24 (VPC) --> tgw-attach-aaaa
192.168.2.0/24 (VPC) --> tgw-attach-bbbb
172.16.0.0/16 (DX-Gateway) --> tgw-attach-cccc
192.168.3.0/24 (CGW) --> tgw-attach-dddd

New Custom TGW Route Table
172.16.0.0/16 (DX-Gateway) --> tgw-attach-cccc
192.168.3.0/24 (CGW) --> tgw-attach-dddd
**NOTE**: VPC CIDRS are exlcuded in order to prevent them from communicating

If I wanted the VPCs to talk to the other (2) networks and NOT EACH OTHER, I would need to:
- create a new route table
- add the networks I wanted to restrict access to (DX-Gateway and CGW)
- associate the (2) VPC routes to the new route table; the router will process traffic coming from the VPCs (their attachments) and forward them to the other (2) networks; if one VPC tries to send traffic to the other VPC, because the custom router that each VPC attachment is associated with DOES NOT have routes for either VPC, that traffic will be dropped.


[ VPC Endpoint Services ]


Direct Connect
------------------

Cross-connect between customer router and the AWS router at the CO-LO or DX Location is a 802.1q trunk:
- single mode fiber (1000BaseLX or 10BaseLR)

Virtual Interface (VIF) = VLAN

Private VIF
   Customer Hardware -> Single VGW (Single VPC)
   Customer Hardware -> DX Gateway -> Up to 10 VGWs (Multi-VPC)

Public VIF
  connections to public AWS services without traversing the internet

Transit VIF




Direct Connect is not secure by default. It is a physical point-to-point connection technology


Billing
-----------------------
Resource Charges = Tiered
Internet Transfer IN = FREE
Internet Transfer OUT = Tiered
VPN = Per Hour + Internet Transfer OUT
Direct Connect = Per Hour 
Private VIF IN = FREE
Private VIF OUT = DC Discounted Rate Per Gb (flat rate)
Public VIF IN = DC Discounted Rate Gb + Resource Charge [Owned Resources]
Public VIF IN = FREE [Non-Owned Resources]

QinQ
-----
- QinQ - a way to associate more than (1) VLAN within a frame; provider tag + customer tag
- Push and pop only works on the "outer" VLAN tag


Classic Load Balancing 
---------------------------
- Multiple Questions on this 
- External Load Balancer (Internet Facing)
- Internal Load Balancer (Internal)

Requirements for External ELB
- Must be in a public subnet 
- CIDR must be at least at /27
- Needs 8 available address to start 

- Cross-Zone Load balancing ensures traffic is evenly distributed at the instance level, not the availability zone level (doesnt take into account the instance size. Only number of instances) 
- Proxy protocol can only be enabled from the AWS CLI



DNS
-----
- Multiple DNS questions on exam 
- +2 resolver is only accessible within the VPC
- Cant use Stub or internally hosted zones and you cant define this and delegate authority to these zone using namesever records
