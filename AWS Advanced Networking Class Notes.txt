Reserved Addresses
------------------
.0 - Network Address
.1 - VPC Router
.2 - DNS (Based on VPC CIDR not subnet)
.3 - Resevered for future use
.255 - Broadcast 


Netwok Refresher
----------------

- Every extra bit borrowed from either host/network doubles (x2) the addresses/subnets available
- /23 subnet is twice the size of a /24 and /22 is twice the size of a /23.

192.168.1.0 /22 - 1024 addresses (512 x 2)
192.168.1.0 /23 = 512 addresses(256 x 2)
192.168.1.0 /24 = 256 addresses (128 x 2)
192.168.1.0 /25 = 128 addresses (64 x 2)
192.168.1.0 /26 = 64 addressess

Design & Implement AWS Networks
-------------------------------

- Source/Destination Check: if an ENI receives traffic where it recognizes that it is not the source or the destination, by default, it automatically drops the packet (if enabled)

- Security Groups are associated with ENI's! NOT INSTANCES
- Multiple security groups can be associated with an instance (per purpose; i.e Active directory)
- Separate security group for the primary ENI and secondary ENI

- NACL's processes traffic before it enter or leaves a subnet  
- Applies to all instances that live in the subnet

- Route Propagation: dynamically adds any routes learned by the attached VGW to the routing table (i.e. routes learned via BGP); this must be explicitly enabled on the router of your choice; you can also use static routes if a routing protocol is not used to form the VPN

- When two VPCs are peered they can "reference" each others security groups

- Within a VPC the public hostname resolves to the private IP address
- With a VPC peer connection if a instance in VPC-A tries to access a instance in VPC-B via it's public hostname, it real resolve to it's public IP address

- VPC Enpoints: a way of accessing a AWS Public Service from within a VPC, without crossing the VPC boundary (only works with S3 and DynamoDB)


Design & Implement Hybrid Networks at Scale
--------------------------------------------

Hybrid Architectures
_________________

People move to the cloud for primarily (2) reasons:

1. Reactive 
2. Proactive 

Reactive is when some kind of event happens 


The subcategories are as follows:

Data center Extension - 

Compliance/Regularoty Reasons -

High Availability/DR -

Dynamic Bursting - 

Organization IT Budget
	CapEx - New equipment 
	CapOps - Operations 


Software Based VPN - good for specific use cases; don’t expect 1-10 Gbps performance even with big instances due to encoding/decoding limitations in software (versus hardware)

AWS Managed VPN - resilent; AWS handles most of the heavy lifting; performance is better than software VPN, but if 10 Gbps is needed, consider Direct Connect

Hardware VPN is always preferred!

Make sure the VGW is aware of the prefixes that are being sent from the CGW!

The information in the AWS config specifies (2) types of IPs when it comes to VPNs:
1. Tunnel Interface IP
2. Public Endpoint IP

Routing Decisions
1. Most Specific Prefix
2. Direct Connect
3. Static Route
4. Routes learned from BGP


CloudHUB -> MPLS


Direct Connect
------------------

Cross-connect between customer router and the AWS router at the CO-LO or DX Location is a 802.1q trunk:
- single mode fiber (1000BaseLX or 10BaseLR)

Virtual Interface (VIF) = VLAN

Direct Connect is not secure by default. It is a physical point-to-point connection technology


Billing
-----------------------
Resource Charges = Tiered
Internet Transfer IN = FREE
Internet Transfer OUT = Tiered
VPN = Per Hour + Internet Transfer OUT
Direct Connect = Per Hour 
Private VIF IN = FREE
Private VIF OUT = DC Discounted Rate Per Gb (flat rate)
Public VIF IN = DC Discounted Rate Gb + Resource Charge [Owned Resources]
Public VIF IN = FREE [Non-Owned Resources]

QinQ
-----
- QinQ - a way to associate more than (1) VLAN within a frame; provider tag + customer tag
- Push and pop only works on the "outer" VLAN tag


Classic Load Balancing 
---------------------------
- Multiple Questions on this 
- External Load Balancer (Internet Facing)
- Internal Load Balancer (Internal)

Requirements for External ELB
- Must be in a public subnet 
- CIDR must be at least at /27
- Needs 8 available address to start 

- Cross-Zone Load balancing ensures traffic is evenly distributed at the “instance” level, not the “availability zone” level (doesn’t take into account the instance size. Only number of instances) 
- Proxy protocol can only be enabled from the AWS CLI



DNS
-----
- Multiple DNS questions on exam 
- +2 resolver is only accessible within the VPC
- Can’t use Stub or internally hosted zones and you can’t define this and delegate authority to these zone using namesever records
