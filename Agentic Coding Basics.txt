Agentic Coding Basics


CLI Tools
-----------
- Claude CLI
- Gemini CLI


Context Window
---------------------
Compact - when the agentic IDE takes historical chats/responses, summarizes it, and passes as additional context to your current prompt; this is normally turned on by default


Models
----------
Composer 1 - fast, decent output
Claude Sonnet 4.5 - average speed and output
Opus - superior model for coding
GPT Codex High 


*Keep in mind I can call multiple models in parallel to test (more expensive)
