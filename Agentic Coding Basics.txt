Agentic Coding Basics


CLI Tools
-----------
- Claude CLI
- Gemini CLI

IDEs
------
- Cursor
- Claude Code
- Visual Studio Code
- Warp

Context Window
---------------------
Compact - when the agentic IDE takes historical chats/responses, summarizes it, and passes as additional context to your current prompt; this is normally turned on by default


Models
----------
Composer 1 - very fast, decent output
Claude Sonnet 4.5 - average speed and output
Opus - superior model for coding
GPT5 Codex High - high reasoning model for complex features
Gemini 3 - great for building user interfaces


*Keep in mind I can call multiple models in parallel to test (more expensive)


Diagrams
-------------
- LLMs can traverse my code base and generate diagrams (mermaid  graphs) that show the interconnectivity --> https://mermaid.live


UI Designs
---------------
- focus on getting one page how I want it and ask the LLM to make all other pages look like that one


Plan In Out
---------------
- cursor and claude have a "plan mode"
- ask LLMs to generate a plan (plan.md file) before having it start to modify actual code
- pass the plan file as context to the LLM to begin implementation
- ask LLMS to generate doc files (doc.md) for certain pieces of your application to make it easier to extend (for example adding a new domain object)
