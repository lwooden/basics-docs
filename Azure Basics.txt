Azure Basics

Azure Active Directory
-----------------------------
- azure ad tenants exist outside of the subscription 
- they are associated (or shared) with a subscription via a trust relationship
- they can also be associated with SaaS offerings (like O365)
- subscriptions can only trust ONE Azure AD tenant

[ Users ]
Synced Users - replicated from on-premises AD infra
Cloud Users - created directly in Azure AD

[ Licesning ]
- done on a per-user basis

[ Objects ]
Users
Groups
	users can be assinged dynamically based on attributes (i.e. Department name)
Service Principles
	these are mapped to enterprise applications or other Azure resources
	can be assumed by VMs (like Instance roles) instead of using access keys
Devices
	hybrird Azure AD join	
	
[ Authentication & Authorization ]

Azure AD Connect #1
	syncs users from on-prem AD structure
	takes the password hash and then hashes it again, and then stores it in AAD
	users can then authenticate against AAD and use the power of Cloud Auth
	
Pass-Through Authentication #2
	for organizations that do not trust their user info being stored in the cloud
	authentication request are sent to AAD -> request are stored in a queue
	agents that are running on the on-prem DC are polling the AAD queue
	processes those request and then sends back a response

Federation #3
	
	
[ Azure Active Directory Domain Services - Traditional AD Service ]
- creates (2) DCs that are fully managed
- you do not have access to them
- supports "basic" group policies
- supplies Kerberos/NTLM/LDAP interfaces for legacy apps/systems
**It is normally better to just extend your on-prem DC and setup custom DNS in Azure


[ Self Service Password Reset ]
- user must enroll in SSPR service in order to be able to verify identity of people trying to make changes to credentials
- SSPR is enabled at the Tenant level and is licensed on a per-user basis
- an authentication method must be set in the enrollment to help with verification (password, authenticator app, SMS, etc)
- can be enabled for "All Users" or a "Group" of users in your AAD structure
- can determine the number of auth methods needed to successfully reset (two-factor)
- passwordreset.microsoft.com (URL for resets)


[ MFA ] 
- can be enfornced based on trusted IP list (e.g user in the corporate network don't have to use MFA)
- can be enforced based on time-range using One-Time ByPass (e.g. 300 seconds, 1 hour)


[ Identity Protection ]
- enabled at the Tenant level and is licensed on a per-user basis (Premium P2 Licensing)
- automates the detection and remediation of identity-based risks
- provides data and reports within the portal
- integrate with security monitoring tools
- all about identifying RISK
- User Risk Policy: 
- Sign In Policy: 

[ Conditional Access ] 
- Premium P1 Licensing
- Signal (IP, device used, risk level) + Decision (block or allow access) + Enforcement
- more fine-grained policies than Identity Protection/MFA
- can define specific applications, devices, location
- can set to Report Only when just starting out in order to test drive policies in your organization


[ PIM ]


[ Access Reviews ]
- go to Azure AD > Identity Governance > Access Reviews
- must first onboard your Azure AD Tenant (P2 License Required)
- create reviews
- reviews access in the "Access Pane"
- supports security group and app reviews


Identity Management
-----------------------------

[ Managed Identities ]
- act like Instance Roles in AWS
- no need to store the secret like we do when we register an application 
- supports several Azure Resources

Azure Resource is assigned a Managed Identity
Managed Identity establishes a Service Principal within Azure
Azure Resources talk to the IMDS (Instance Metadata Service) to get tokens in order to invoke actions against other services

App Service > Identity > System Assigned > Change status to "ON"


[ User Identities ]


Governance
----------------

[ Org Strucuture ]

Azure Tenant
  Subscriptions 
     Resource Groups
     
**tags can be applied at the sub, rg, and resource level 

[ Management Groups ]
- allows us to apply policies easily to subscriptions 

Root Management Group
  top of the hierarchy 
  policies applied here are "global"

Management Group Hierarchy
  up to 6 levels 
  one management group can have multiple children 
  one mg sub can only have one parent 

Subscriptions 
  function like the "children"
  policies flow down to the subs

[ Azure Policy ]

Monitoring for a condition 
  does the resource “location” property = “US West”?

Trigger
  what to do if the condition is met
  append, audit, deny, modify 

Assignment 
  policies must be assigned to a scope 
  management group, subscription, resource group, resource 

[ Initiatives ] 
- an object that ties together multiple policies in order to achieve an overall goal 

// Example //
Location (Scope): Low Dev Subscription
Name: Allowed Locations
Definitions (Policies): 1) allowed locations 2) allowed locations for resource groups 

[ Blueprints ]


Secrets Management
-----------------------------

[ Azure Key Vault ] 
- functions like Secrets Manager in AWS
- the endpoint for your vault can be set to public or private

KeyVault (container - HSM w/ API)
  Secret Information (secrets, keys, certificates, etc)
     Access Policies (security)
     
     

 Data Storage Solutions
 --------------------------------
 
[ Storage Accounts ]
- should be nested within a resource group
- 3 different properties associated with a storage account: 
  Kind
  Performance Tier
  Replication
  Access Tier

Azure Blobs
	object oriented storage (similar to S3)

Azure Files 
	traditional file sharing services; desinged for SMB connectivity; default quota is 5TB
	internal access: REST, SMB 2.1 and SMB 3.0
	public internet: REST, SMB 3.0

Azure Tables 
	simple storage for non-relational semi-structured data (key/value store)

Azure Queues 
	simple messaging service (similar to SQS)

Naming convention is as follows:
<storageaccountname>.<service>.core.windows.net

lowsandbox.blob.core.windowns.net
lowsandbox.files.core.windows.net
lowsandbox.files.queue.windows.net
lowsandbox.table.core.windows.net


[ Storage Account Replication ] 

Local Redundant Storage (LRS) 
	3 copies of data within a SINGLE data center

Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)
	3 copies across (3) availability zones in the primary region
	
Geo Redundant Storage  (GRS) 
	3 copies across within a SINGLE data center and x3 async copies into another region 
	
Geo Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS)
	3 copies across (3) availability zones in the primary region and x3 copies in another region

**Forced Failover - the ability to tell Azure to update the underlying storage account DNS record to point to the secondary endpoint instead of the primary; check "Last Synced Time"; only supported in GRS or RA-GRS


[ Storage Account Security ] 
- all storage account services come with public endponts by default

Storage Firewall
	shapes network access to storage accounts

Access Keys
	gives a user/service full management and data layer access 

Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
	a URI that describes what a types of permission a user/service has; permissions cannot be modified after the SAS is generated

Role Based Access (RBAC)
	provides access based to the management and data layer based on Azure Active Directory
	
- Create a "Service Principal" (AAD Dashboard > App Registration)
- Register an application in AAD by giving it a secret
- Associate the service principal with a role (Access Control IAM)
- a successful login by the app (via the api) returns a "token" that the app can then use to pass to a service to perform an action 


Data Processing Solutions
-----------------------------------

Azure Databricks

Synapse



Databases
--------------


Structured Data Options (rows and columns)
	
[  Azure SQL Database ]
- supports "some" SQL features but not all
Autoscale

Service Tiers
	General Purpose
	Business Critical (Always-On Availability Group)
	Hyperscale (Sharding)

- optimized for IOT
- 500mb memory footprint

	

Semi Structured Options (JSON, XML)

[  Azure Tables  ]
- backed by an Azure Storage Account
- stores data that may change structure as "entities" in tabular format (semi-structured)
- focuses on storing alot of data at a low price point 
- pricing is determined per GB of storage
- 20k operations per second
- latency guarantees

Partition Key - functions like Cosmos DB
Row Key - must be included with every entitiy

**these properties must be referenced in any query in order for data to be returned

*Partiion keys are immutable! Containers must be deleted if you want to change them

US customer data -> Server 1
Canda customer data -> Server 2

Pricing
	Request Units (RUs)  - abstract way to measure/charge for resources required to interact w/ data
	Cosmos appends an "item id" with each document in order to identify each unique document (1 document = 1 RU)

Point Read - requesting (1) item
In-Partition - requesting data located in a single partition (WHERE CUSTOMER = US)
Cross-Partion -  requesting data located in more than one partition (US and Canada)

Replication
	replicates data seemlessly between regions (read replicas)
	multi-region writes (read/write replicas)




Networking
--------------

[ Virtual Networks ] 
- lose 5 addresses with each subnet
- for Gateway subnets it's best to provision a /27 (16 addresses) so you can run Express Route and S2S VPN
- Express Route is not encrypted 
- default paths are 1) intra-vnet traffic 2) internet connectivity
- peering now allows for routing to be automatically configured from both Vnets using the wizard
- peering can happen across region and subscriptions (must know resource-id)
- non-transitive

[ Network Security Groups ] 
- NSGs are linked to subnets
- focused on filtering traffic, not routing (Security Groups)
- can apply to the subnet or interface level
- cannot remove Default Rules
- can modify based on "Priority" (lower the number, higher the priority)
- by default ALL INBOUND ACCESS is enabled on a "Basic" SKU Public IP
- by default ALL INBOUND ACCESS is blocked on "Standard" SKU Public IP
-  SERVICE TAGS abstract references to Azure services since recording IP addresses for those services is complex

[ Application Security Groups ] 
- logical container for network interfaces
- NICs are associated with ASGs
- "Web-ASG" would apply to the NIC of all VMs in the "Web Fleet"
- ASGs are scoped to Vnets; all NICs must be in the same Vnet

- VPN Gateway resources are deployed into a special subnet called "Gateway Subnet"
- connections are terminated over the internet (public IP address)
- Allow Forwarded Traffic
- Allow Gateway Transit must be enabled in the hub vnet to pass traffic transitively to other spoke vnets
- Use Remote Gateway must be enabled in the spoke vnet to tell it to use the gateway that is configured in the hub vnet


[ Service Endpoints ]
- configured at the subnet level of a Vnet
- provides a new "private" route for resources in the vnet to reach Mircosoft services
- provides the private address as a source IP address when accessing services
- DOES NOT establish private IP address for the services being accessed (like Private Link)
- not all services support service endpoints so check before implementing


[ Private Link ] 
- private IP addresses within a subnet that point to a particular service


[ WAN Connectivity ] 

Point-to-Site

Site-to-Site

ExpressRoute

- highlight a VM > Capture



Automation
---------------

[ ARM Templates ] 
- resources are deployed to a resource group
- two different deployment modes
- Complete: everything in the template must match what is in the resource group; if there is something in the template that is not in the resource group it will be deleted
- Incremental: if resource does not exist in the resource group, it will be created; if the resource already exist, it will be updated; no resources are deleted
- can be deployed via Powershell, AzureCLI, the portal, VSCode
- you can auto-generate a template by using the "Export Template" option on an existing resource group 


[ Runbooks ] 
- similiar to CloudFormation/Lambda
- supports Powershell or Python scripting
- simplify orchestration of complex multi-step tasks
- you must install/enable the modules under the "Shared Resources" section for the resources that you want to interact with (e.g. Az.Compute for VMs)
