High Level Review
----------------------------

Resource Groups - a container that holds all of the resources you provision


Manage Azure Subscriptions
--------------------------------------
Azure Enterprise --> http://ea.azure.com
	Departments
		Accounts --> http://account.azure.com
			Subscriptions (Management Groups) --> http://portal.azure.com
				Resource Groups
					Resources

LA Engineering (Enterprise)
	Finance (Department)
		Finance Dev/Test (Account)
			Subscription 1
		Finance Stage (Account)
			Subscription 2
			Subscription 3
   
The department level can be set up to be: functional (Finance, IT), business divsion (Auto, Aerospace), geographic (North America, Europe)

Know how to set Billing Alerts: Subscriptions > Manage > Enable Billing Alert Feature > Click Subscription > Create Alert
Know how to assign polices at the subscription level and monitor compliance


Analyze Resource Utilization and Consumption
--------------------------------------------------------------


Managing Resource Groups
------------------------------------

Can set RBACS 
Can set locks On resources (delete or read only - most restrictive)
Can set up polices 
Can set up tagging 
Can set up automated deployments 


[Policies]

azure governance 
Built in or custom code
Assigned to subscriptions or specific resource groups 


Storage Accounts
-----------------------

Blobs 

GPv1
GPv2 (best choice and will be the baseline going forward)
Blob Account 
Hot, Cold, Archive

Download azcopy, azure storage explorer and play

Shared Access Signature (SAS) - query string that it added to the end of a URL of a storage resource; the string defines the access 
Service SAS Token - grants access to a specific service in a storage account 
Account SAS Token - granted at the account level to grant permissions to services within the account 


Import/Export
---------------


Azure FileSync
--------------------

Create storage account 
Create file share 
Create azure file sync service in resource group 
Register vm by using install script 
Create server endpoint in azure file sync by selecting server I registered 
Choose location on server to sync data


Azure Backup - WATCH AGAIN
------------------
High Availbility
Disaster Recovery
Backup

Unlimited DataTransfer - not charged for data in or out

Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) - replicates 3 copies within the local datacenter
Geo Redundant Storage (GRS) - moves copies of data to a secondary datacenter hundreds of miles away out of region

MARS - Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent

Azure Backup Agent (MARS) - file level recovery 
System Center DPM - can be used on prem with Azure Backup
Azure Backup Server - VM or on premise backups
Azure Iaas VM Backup - 
Snapshot Recovery - blob snapshots taken of VM page blob; vms get created from snapshot; application consistent if VM was shutdown

1. Create Recovery Valut Resource
2. Define Backup Goal (where and what you want to back up)
3. Choose backup policy
4. Select VMs to back up
5. Go to VM detials and select Operations -> Backup to check status


Virtual Machines
--------------------

[Series]
A - Basic = testing and development
A - Standard = general purpose
B - Burstable = burst to full capacity of CPU when needed
D - General Purpose = for enterprise applications
E - Memory Optimized = high memory-to-CPU ratio
F - CPU Optimized = high CPU core-to-memory ratio
G - Godzilla = large databases + bigdata
H - High Performance Compute =
L - Storage Optimized = high I/O
M - Large Memory = large scale memory option; up to 3.5TB of RAM
N - GPU enabled = GPU enabled
SAP Hanna = specialized for SAP 

[Specialization]
M - Larger Memory
R - Supports Remote Directory
S - Premium Storage

Example = DS (General Purpose + Premium Storage)

[Windows Server Support]
Pre-Windows 2008 R2 - supported for deployment but must bring your own image; no marketplace support;
2008 R2 - supported; see matrix for server roles
2012 - supported; datacenter
2016 - suppored; datacenter and nano 
Desktop - 10 Pro and Enterprise in Marketplace
Other Servers in the Microsoft Ecosystem (e.g. exchage, bizatalk, forefront identity manager)

[Linux]
CentOS
CoreOS
Debian
Oralce Linux
Red Hat
SUSE/openSUSE

[Availability Optons]
Availabity sets - same datacenter, but seperate racks and power
Availability zone - same region, but seperate datacenters

**Autoshutdown is native to Azure 
**Can download automated version of your deployment for future use
