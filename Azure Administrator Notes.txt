ACG - Microsoft Azure Administrator

High Level Review
----------------------------

Resource Groups - a container that holds all of the resources you provision


Manage Azure Subscriptions
--------------------------------------
Azure Enterprise --> http://ea.azure.com
	Departments
		Accounts --> http://account.azure.com
			Subscriptions (Management Groups) --> http://portal.azure.com
				Resource Groups
					Resources

LA Engineering (Enterprise)
	Finance (Department)
		Finance Dev/Test (Account)
			Subscription 1
		Finance Stage (Account)
			Subscription 2
			Subscription 3
   
The department level can be set up to be: functional (Finance, IT), business division (Auto, Aerospace), geographic (North America, Europe)

Know how to set Billing Alerts: Subscriptions > Manage > Enable Billing Alert Feature > Click Subscription > Create Alert
Know how to assign polices at the subscription level and monitor compliance


Analyze Resource Utilization and Consumption
---------------------------------------------


Managing Resource Groups
------------------------

Can set RBACS 
Can set locks On resources (delete or read only - most restrictive)
Can set up polices 
Can set up tagging 
Can set up automated deployments 


[Policies]

azure governance 
Built in or custom code
Assigned to subscriptions or specific resource groups 


Storage Accounts
-----------------------

Blobs 

GPv1
GPv2 (best choice and will be the baseline going forward)
Blob Account 
Hot, Cold, Archive

Download azcopy, azure storage explorer and play

Shared Access Signature (SAS) - query string that it added to the end of a URL of a storage resource; the string defines the access 
Service SAS Token - grants access to a specific service in a storage account 
Account SAS Token - granted at the account level to grant permissions to services within the account 


Import/Export
---------------


Azure FileSync
--------------------

Create storage account 
Create file share 
Create azure file sync service in resource group 
Register vm by using install script 
Create server endpoint in azure file sync by selecting server I registered 
Choose location on server to sync data


Azure Backup - WATCH AGAIN
------------------

High Availability
Disaster Recovery
Backup

Unlimited DataTransfer - not charged for data in or out

Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) - replicates 3 copies within the local datacenter
Geo Redundant Storage (GRS) - moves copies of data to a secondary datacenter hundreds of miles away out of region

MARS - Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent

Azure Backup Agent (MARS) - file level recovery 
System Center DPM - can be used on prem with Azure Backup
Azure Backup Server - VM or on premise backups
Azure Iaas VM Backup - 
Snapshot Recovery - blob snapshots taken of VM page blob; vms get created from snapshot; application consistent if VM was shutdown

1. Create Recovery Vault Resource
2. Define Backup Goal (where and what you want to back up)
3. Choose backup policy
4. Select VMs to back up
5. Go to VM details and select Operations -> Backup to check status


Virtual Machines
--------------------

[Series]

A - Basic = testing and development
A - Standard = general purpose
B - Burstable = burst to full capacity of CPU when needed
D - General Purpose = for enterprise applications
E - Memory Optimized = high memory-to-CPU ratio
F - CPU Optimized = high CPU core-to-memory ratio
G - Godzilla = large databases + bigdata
H - High Performance Compute =
L - Storage Optimized = high I/O
M - Large Memory = large scale memory option; up to 3.5TB of RAM
N - GPU enabled = GPU enabled
SAP Hanna = specialized for SAP 

[Specialization]

M - Larger Memory
R - Supports Remote Directory
S - Premium Storage

Example = DS (General Purpose + Premium Storage)

[Windows Server Support]

Pre-Windows 2008 R2 - supported for deployment but must bring your own image; no marketplace support;
2008 R2 - supported; see matrix for server roles
2012 - supported; datacenter
2016 - suppored; datacenter and nano 
Desktop - 10 Pro and Enterprise in Marketplace
Other Servers in the Microsoft Ecosystem (e.g. exchange, biztalk, forefront identity manager)

[Linux]

CentOS
CoreOS
Debian
Oracle Linux
Red Hat
SUSE/openSUSE

[Availability Options]

Availability sets - same datacenter, but separate racks and power
Availability zone - same region, but separate datacenters

**Autoshutdown is native to Azure 
**Can download automated version of your deployment for future use



Automate VM Deployments
-----------------------

Cattle vs Pets

Powershell DSC | VM Extensive | Scripts

Enterprise Approach: Puppet + Chef
Getting Started: Powershell DSC


Powershell DSC (Desired State Configuration)
  Configurations
    Resources
      Logical Configuration Manager


Configuration SkylinesWebSite <-- Name of config
{
  Node 'localhost' <--- Resource to apply to 
  {
    #Install IIS - Enabled via Windows Feature  <--- What I am configuring
     WindowsFeature IIS
      {
       Ensure = "Present"
       Name= "Web-Server"
      }
    #Install ASP.NET 4.5
    WindowsFeature ASP
    {
    Ensure = "Present"
    Name= "Web-Asp-Net45"
    }
  }
}


Save file

Prepare for consumption by Azure
  PS > Publish-AzureRmCMDsConfiguration -ConfigurationPath <location of file> -OutputArchivePath <file>.zip

Choose a VM from the Virtual Machine Menu

Go to Extensions and "Add"

Choose Powershell DSC
  Select zip file from command


[Custom Script Extension]

- execute VM tasks without logging into the VM (no credentials or IPs needed to connect)
- automate using Powershell
- must be enabled on per VM basis
- slow

[PowerShell VM Commands]

New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name lowsandbox -Location EastUS
New-AzureRmVM 


Manage VM Storage and Networking
-------------------------------

Standard Storage (S)
- HDD
- Cost savings
- Max throughput 60MB/S per disk
- Max IOPS 500 IOPS per disk

Premium Storage (P)
- SSD
- High perf
- Max throughput 250 MB/s
- Max IOPS 7500 


Unmanaged Disks Vs Managed Disks

Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) - replicates 3 copies within the same local datacenter
Zone Replicated Storage (ZRS) - same as above plus replication between one or two datacenters
Geo Redundant Storage (GRS) - moves copies of data to a secondary datacenter hundreds of miles away out of region

Disk Caching (Instance Storage) 
- improves performance
- uses local RAM and SSD drives of the host
- available on standard and premium

OS disk -> default: read/write -> read-only or read-write
Data disk -> default: none -> none, read-only or read-write

*Must be enabled through Powershell


Must specifically define Private IPs as "static" at the NIC level
Can customize DNS Servers per VM at even after it has been launched


VM Availability
----------------

Potential VM Impacts
- planned maintenance (Azure hardware)
- unplanned hardware maintenance
- unexpected downtown

Availability Sets
- group (2) or more VMs in a set
- separate fault and update domains

Fault Domain 0 | Fault Domain 1 | Fault Domain 2
Update Domain 0 |  Update Domain 1 | Update Domain 2

Availability Sets or Availability Zones (can't have both - preference is Zone)



VM Scale Sets
-------------

- used for "horizontal" scaling to meet demand or based on metrics
- define instance count, size
- determine auto-scale or not (minimum maximum)

Search "Scale sets" in the search bar
Create virtual scale set


Azure Networking
-----------------

Azure reserves first (5) IPs from the VNET
- first three IPs
- last IP

First useable address in a /24 is .4

Static addresses are just DHCP Reservations


[Private DNS Zone]

Create Private DNS Zone
Add virtual link to associate the zone with a network
Select "Enable auto registration"
Test pinging from 2 different VMs using their private host names


[Public DNS Zone]
