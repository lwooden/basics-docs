SRE Application to DHS

Things to automate:

1) Instance provisioning -> Cloud Form
2) Backups -> ???

Interferences:

1) For AWS CLI access token continously expires after one hour - RESOLVED

------------------

Friction Points:

"We want to launch anything, any time, without hindrance." (Us)

"They don't ever want to change anything unless it goes through 10 different approvals." (Security)

Product Development Team - Missions (ADT,AIC,TRDS,etc)
AWS Operations - Me
CLAN Operations - SENS3/Security

Dev-Ops-Ops :(

------------------

Time Management (as-is):
- 100% spent on Ops
- 0% spent on Engineering

Time Management (should-be):
- 50% ops
- 50% engineering 

------------------

Changes Needed:

1) "Postmortems" should be written for all events/failures/issues
2) "Availability targets" need to be defined per mission
3) "Error budgets" also need to be defined per system
